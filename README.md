# UreterStoneYOLO

Python implementation for automated detection of ureteral stones on kidney‚Äìureter‚Äìbladder (KUB) radiographs, using transfer learning with **YOLOv11**.

This repository accompanies the research project on deep learning‚Äìbased ureteral stone detection.  
All experiments were conducted using YOLOv11 with fine-tuning on institutionally collected medical radiographs.

## üß† Overview

UreterStoneYOLO provides a reproducible implementation of a detection pipeline for ureteral stones using kidney‚Äìureter‚Äìbladder (KUB) X-rays.  
The goal is to assist radiologists in identifying small ureteral stones with optimized detection sensitivity and minimal false positives.
